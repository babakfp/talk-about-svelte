## Layouts

### Manual refreshes

Sometimes when you change something or anything in the code in the layout file, it doesn't get updated on the browser, so you need to refresh the page manually to see the new changes.

### Limited slot functionality

It has a limited `<slot>` functionality. For example, you can't have a layout with named slots, and you can't use that slots in your page component. Example:

`__layout.svelte`:

```HTML
Some content here...

<slot/>

<slot name="place-a"/>

Some content here...

<slot name="place-b"/>
```

`__index.svelte` file:

```HTML
<div slot="place-a"></div>
<div slot="place-b"></div>
```

Basically features related to component slots are missing in layouts.

### Pass data between page and layout

You can't pass data from a page to a layout or vice versa.
