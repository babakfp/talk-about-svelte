## Logic blocks syntax

The current syntax is weird and hard to remember, especially for beginners. Let's use a simple and clean syntax like the example below.

```
{@if}
{@else if}
{@else}
{@endif}
```

### Consistency

Let's have good consistency between different tools and features. This new syntax will help us to have better consistency with features like [`{@html}`](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/html-tags), [named layouts](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#named-layouts), and more.

### `{@html}`

[`{@html}`](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/html-tags) is already using this `{@}` syntax:

```
{@html myMarkdownContent}
```

### Named layouts

We can also see this `{@}` syntax being used in [named layouts](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#named-layouts):

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„__layout-potato.svelte
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„index@potato.svelte
```

### `$lib`

In my opinion, it's wrong to use the `$` symbol anywhere other than in stores. Let's change the default aliases syntax to: `@lib`. This will make Brittney so happyðŸ˜„.

```HTML
<script>
  import MyComponent from '@lib/MyComponent.svelte'
</script>
```
