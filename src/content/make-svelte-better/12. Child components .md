## Child components

This is your pure JS code:

```HTML
<div class="div"></div>
<div class="div"></div>
<div class="div"></div>

<script>
  const all = document.querySelectorAll('.div') // NodeList(3)Â [div.div, div.div, div.div]

  all.forEach(div => {
    div.addEventListener('click', _=> {

      // Remove previously added class from all elements.
      all.forEach(div => div.classList.remove('something'))

      div.classList.add('something')
    })
  })
</script>
```

How can you do the same in Svelte? It's not easy. I couldn't figure it out on my own, so I decided to look out some source code. Eventually, I learned some stuff but I didn't really learn it so I couldn't replicate it.
