## Translation

```HTML
<!-- I Prefer this: -->
<p>__(Hello World)</p>

<!-- Over this: -->
<p>{__('Hello World')}</p>
```

### Other examples:

```HTML
<p>__(Is true? {answer})</p>

<p>__u(Is true? {answer})</p>

<p>__html(<span>Hello World</span>)</p>

<p>__(Is true? __answer{isSomething ? 'Yes' : 'Yes!'})</p>
```

---

### Why it's better?

- It's a lot more readable and easy to do in comparison to other solutions.
- We use `__` instead of `t` because it's a known standard for translations.
