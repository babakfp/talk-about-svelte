## Logic blocks syntax

```
{@if}
{@else if}
{@else}
{@endif}
```

Do the same for the other blocks too.

### Why it's better?

- Better consistency with `{@html}` and the other blocks.
- Better consistency with Named Layouts.
- A *simple*, *beginner friendly* and *memorable* syntax without `#`, `:`, `/`.
