## CSS Scope

Styling in Svelte is limited and this is the solution:

---

Styles are scoped and will get removed if not being used.

```html
<style></style>
```

---

Styles are scoped and will **not** get removed if not being used.

```html
<style scope="keep"></style>
```

---

Styles are global and will **not** get removed if not being used.

```html
<style scope="global"></style>
```
