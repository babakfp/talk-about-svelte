> He means Accessibility: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility

Is my changes 100% accessible?😂 Such a silly question!. Let me ask, is the Svelte site 100% accessible? Let me answer, it doesn't even cover the basics. Now I'm confused because I didn't see any PR's from you related to accessibility. Why is that?:
- You don't know what accessibility is. Maybe you do because you sent me a wiki link about it😂.
- You don't care about accessibility but you mention it in public.

Did you (@dummdidumm) look at the commits? I'm sure you didn't because then you would know that I know what the heck accessibility is and I spend a good time making sure that it's accessible. But you didn't bother yourself, did you?

previous commenters, they didn't look at what is changed, didn't look at the code, not even comments, and not even the commits. "Oh you did this but I don't know why!", You would know why, if you just take your time to review instead of questioning me.

Thank you (@dummdidumm) for the article, but it's not related, because you don't use a select box for page navigation😂. It's like using a banana🍌 instead of a telephone📞. Just because it was used before, it doesn't mean that you need to keep it🙂.

It has keyboard navigation support. It's not a select box, so we don't need to use aria stuff like how explained in that article. I should have used nav. It's a hardcode test, it's not a community project. If you do something wrong, if the maintainers don't like you or for any reason, you'll be failed.

Just because Microsoft, Apple did something, it doesn't mean that it's right. I'm sure some people going to say "Oh you think you are smarter than Apple and Microsoft?" 😂 Let's don't fool ourselves. Those products have problems that we are all faced with. Even there are some problems that they didn't fix since years ago.

"Hey, explain this thing to someone that didn't bother to read the commits, or to someone that didn't even read the code comments"
No thanks😂

Mr. @pngwn, if you see any problem in the code, you kindly ask the author to do the fixes (and of course you explain the problems and why and how). You don't just close the PR. There is 100 open PR's and you just couldn't help yourself not to close this one.

> we don't want to introduce unnecessary dependencies for simple functionality like 'click outside'.

Sure, just reinvent the wheels because who knows, you just don't like adding packages👏. Hearing this from someone that uses Svelte!🙂 (Not good for Svelte😂). "Oh, it's not good to import a 20 line pure Svelte component package into your project, it's very bad". Don't let MR. Rich sees it🙂.

> I'd encourage you to open an issue before making pull requests like this. Closing until that conversation has taken place.

I sawed a problem and I solved it. What is the need for an extra step? You can analyze my PR with the current version and in any subject, it is way much better.

I don't understand why it has to be like this with the Svelte community.
1. I designed a UI and a logo for the SvelteKit and sent them into discord chat (it's related topic/group). Some users came and say their opinions. Didn't like any of them but as I said, they were an opinion with some more or less reason behind it. I and other users talk about this stuff and suddenly I see the cat removed. As you guessed, I was completely removed from the community🙂🙂. [🖕🏿] mail this to the person that removed me. Thanks.
2. Two times or so, I asked a question on discord community and got replies like (You have a problem if you are trying to do just think/task. No one in the world does that, so you have a problem, and...)🙂.
3. I decided to play with Svelte source and see what's up... My hours of time were wasted because of the poor documentation. I created a PR and explained very well, step by step to how to set up Svelte to develop it. 

I created a PRR last time and a few users comes and says ("Ah, it's bad", "I didn't like it"). Just some nonsense comments. I ask a question in the discord chat, someone comes and says "Why do you need that, that is bad, you shouldn't do that". I Design a UI for the SvelteKit website and send it into discord and some people come and say "dark mode is bad" and..., it was fine because these comments simply were an opinion. But then I see I removed from the discord chat🙂
