Hi
Honestly, I do like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) (SvelteJS, Svelte Framework) but there is a big problem...

Today, I create a [PR request](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6851) and it got me blocked.

The short story is that the community is toxic. You can find really good people [(Svelte discord group)](https://svelte.dev/chat) but a single !good person can ruin everything (It's more that 1).

### This is my deleted comment content:

@Rich-Harris Hey, you may want to read thisðŸ™‚

<OtherContent>
	<TheGithubComment />
</OtherContent>

You can see the PR request from [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6851).
