Hi

It's unfair to me that I got blocked from the community (2 times) for no reason. I'm not a terrorist, not even a rude person on the internet, I'm just a developer, like every one of us that likes to create stuff. So it means that it can happen to anyone of us, even you.

Would you like to suddenly get removed from the community, in the middle of the chat? You get no answers no explanation. You are just get thrown out like the morning trash.

Would you like to spend your time (the time that you never gonna get it back) to fix/create something, and in the end, some guy throws it away. Based on 

I spend few years of my development journey helping people, answering their questions, and managing the group. I was a time that I was available 24/7 only for the community to answer them, it was like an olympiad game combined with the squid game. It was wild.

If someone says "I want to learn x and y", you don't just go and say "this is the course link. bye". If someone is sending ads, you don't just block its account, if you care, you will try to act for the best for both the user and the community. You can't say "ah, this user is kinda annoying", I'm gonna remove him. I see something from a user, what do I do? I search for all of his messages in all the groups we both are in. I read the messages and see the engagement, what he and other users talking about, how much his knowledge is about x and y topic, I analyze so many stuff and in the end, there are some options (remove, keep, valuable, need more info, she is cute).
