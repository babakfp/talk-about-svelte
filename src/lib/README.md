# I like Svelte but, I hate it!

*I'm angry, disappointed, and hopeful.* Why I hate Svelte?, Why I like Svelte, What is the possitive and negative points of using Svelte?, Should you learn Svelte? Is learning Svelte worth it? I'm gonna answer them all.

## Why I'm angry and disappointed?

- I got blocked for a lifetime from Svlete Discord group.
- I got blocked for a lifetime from Svelte GitHub repositories.
- I got blocked for a lifetime from <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dev.to</a> because of the article that I wrote about Svelte.
- Svelte isn't a community project. It's just an open-source project.
- Maintainers don't know anything about how to manage a community, manage a group, or simply anything!.
- Toxic people live in the community and the maintainers don't do anything about it.
- MR. Rich Harris doesn't involve with the community.
- It's not good to use third-party libraries in your Svelte project!.

### I got blocked for a lifetime **from Svlete Discord group**

Svelte documentation UI sucks, right? In 2021 I designed a UI and a logo for SvelteKit. I sent them to the Discord group and we talked about the design and related stuff with some people in the group. In the middle of the conversation, *suddenly I got blocked and removed completely from the group!*. I didn't find any of my messages in the Discord group. They probably cleaned up everything after removing me😄. <a href="https://bit.ly/3tf6mPL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">*You can download all UI and logo design source files I ever create for Svelte.*</a>

*This is the result of contributing to svelte:*

### I got blocked for a lifetime **from Svelte GitHub repositories**

It was so hard for me to use this dropdown, so I decided to fix it and send a PR. I did it but I couldn't predict what was going to happen after.

This is how it went:

And here it is the comment that got me banned (this was removed after I got banned):

### I got blocked for a lifetime **from <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dev.to</a> because of the article that I wrote about Svelte**

The same day after I got blocked from Svelte GitHub, I write an article about it and it's got me blocked because someone reported it. I don't know who reported it but it was someone that wasn't happy about its content. Well, this is the article:

<OtherContent>
	<TheDevtoArticle />
</OtherContent>

As I said, I got blocked also the article too. So, the article wasn't visible after that and I wasn't able to do anything. I contacted with the dev.to support and they didn't really answer why the article got blocked😂

#### I replayed to one of the comments under this article

I'm not sure but I think this is the reply that I write to a comment under the article.

### Maintainers don't know anything about how to manage a community

Svelte maintainers don't know what the heck they are doing. Did anyone see the Svelte Summit live 🐕💩 video quality? They don't even try to do a good job. Svelte maintainers never managed a community before so they are doing dumb 💩 all the time. You can easily find toxic people in Svelte's GitHub and Discord community and the maintainers don't/won't do anything about it, but for sure they will ban you for life for no reason.

If you are a back-end developer and this is everything you know, you don't get to make decisions for example about the UI design. If you don't know how to manage a group or a community, don't even try it. *Don't do 💩 that you don't know anything about.*

### MR. Rich Harris doesn't involve with the community

You can't find Rich Harris in the Svelte's Discord community. Sense 2020 taht I started using Svelte, I never see him in the community. There is no account with the name of Rich Harris in the group. He is the creator of the Svelte and it's impossible to se him intract with the community. Other people try to help each other in this group (other than the Svelte's toxic members) but Rich Harris never came to say Hi!. Weird right? *Do not lie, I had a little bit of interaction with him on GitHub. I also see him replying/answering some Twitter comments.*

### Last Talks

I like the tool but not the everything that comes with it that it's *absolutely disgusting*.

## Other negative things about Svelte

I already explained some of the negative points of Svelte but it's literally endless😐 So let's talk more.

- Slow development (because of:)
  * Bad (code, work, ) managment
  * Unreadable bad source code
  * No documentation or roadmap or anything
- No role management for maintainers
- Toxic people in the community
- Not alot of content avalible
- Not a great documentation
- Uncertain *future* with unknown *features* in the future.
- etc

## About me

I'm a front-end developer. I have around 5 years of experience in development in general. I also have a good knowledge and experience in UI design and Wordpress theme and plugin development. I'm a community manager since 4 or 5 years ago. I started to use Svelte in 2020.

### How I introduced to Svelte?

In a dev-related group, someone was talking about how Svelte is easy to use and etc. I jumped into the conversation and I asked what about the performance? He sent me a screenshot of a comparison between Svelte and other front-end frameworks and Svelte was above all.
