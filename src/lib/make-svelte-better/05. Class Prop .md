I don't know about the technical things. Let's think about the simplest thing that the compiler can do. So, I'm a compiler and I look at this component:

```html
<script>
  import Comp from '$lib/Comp.svelte'
</script>

<Comp class="btn" />

<style>
	.btn { color: red }
</style>
```

I see that there is a component with the class prop and maybe it's used as an HTML class attribute. Let's verify it, to do this I need to look at the `<style>` tag, is there a class name called `btn`? Hmm, there is and it has some styles. I'm going to say that this class prop is the same HTML class attr. Ok so I need to don't remove the btn class styles and I also need to add a unique classs along with this btn value.
