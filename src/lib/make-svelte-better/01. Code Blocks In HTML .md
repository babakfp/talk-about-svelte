## Code Blocks In HTML

### If Block

```
{@if <>}
{@else if <>}
{@else}
{@endend}
```

### Each Block

```
{@each <> as <>}
{@endeach}

{@each <> as <>, i}
{@endeach}
```

### Keyed Each Block

It's better to call it 'key each' instead of 'keyed each' because 'keyed each' sounds alien.

### Await Block

```
{@await <>}
{@then <>}
{@catch <>}
{@endawait}
```
