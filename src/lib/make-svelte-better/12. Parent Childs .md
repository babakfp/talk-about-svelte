## Parent Childs

A feature to easily communicate between parent and child data, functions and basically everything. The Context API doesn't really help here.

```html
<script>
	// Get child component value
	console.log(#AccordionItem.value)

	// Set all child components value
	##AccordionItem.isOpen = false
</script>
```
